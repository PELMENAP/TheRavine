### Git

I recommend installing this package directly through the [Unity Asset Store](#unity-asset-store). However, if you want faster access to new developments, feel free to install it directly from Git.

#### 1. Get the import link from GitHub

Copy this link: https://github.com/skner-dev/DualGrid.git

#### 2. Import from Git in Package Manager

Inside Unity Editor, open the Window -> Package Manager.

In the new Package Manager window, click on the plus button and click on Add -> _Install package from git URL..._
