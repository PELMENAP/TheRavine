# Dual Grid

Welcome to the repository of my Dual Grid implementation for Unity.

Available in the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/skner-s-dual-grid-301999)!

## Features

Here's what this library can do:

- üî• __Fully working Dual Grid System__: Paint a Data Tilemap and it all gets visually updated in a Render Tilemap.
- üîÑ __Automatic Setup__: It takes seconds to setup a dual grid system;
- ü§ù __Full Unity Integration__: Full integration with Unity's Tilemap and Rule Tiles;
- üß© __Rule Tile Creation__: Streamlined rule tile creation with full rule definition;

## The Dual Grid Tilemap

The Dual Grid Tilemap is a method to render tiles using two grids, instead of one. One grid is to indicate what each tile is and the render tilemap renders tiles with a half-tile offset in both axis. 

Many people use different terms for each grid, but in this library you'll find the __Data Tilemap__ and the __Render Tilemap__.

These are the big reasons (in my view) why using this approach is powerful:

- üöÄ __Scalability__: Create all tilemap combinations with only 16 tiles, saving a lot of work.
- ‚ú® __Corner design flexibility__: Fully round corners not possible with traditional tilemap structures.

To learn more about how this technique works, which I recommend, check my [user guide](Documentation~/user-guide.md), or these useful resources:

- [Jess Hammer's Youtube Dual-Grid Tutorial](https://youtu.be/jEWFSv3ivTg)
- [Oskar St√•lberg's Twitter Post](https://x.com/OskSta/status/1448248658865049605)

## Getting started

To start using this library, check the [installation guide](Documentation~/installation-guide.md). It has a guide on how to __install__ and __setup__ the library with a detailed explanation.

To start using it, I recommend the [user guide](Documentation~/user-guide.md). It's a page with an article on how to use the dual grid with detailed explanations.

If you're looking for quick step-by-step usage instructions, there's also a [cheatsheet](Documentation~/cheatsheet.md).

## Dependencies

This library depends on:
- [Unity 2D Tilemap Extras 3.1.2](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@3.1/manual/index.html)
- [Unity 2D Tilemap Editor 1.0.0](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.tilemap@1.0/manual/index.html) 

This package is compatible with __Unity 2021.3__ or newer.

## Author's note

I knew about the Dual Grid system before, but seeing [Jess Hammer's implementation](https://github.com/jess-hammer/dual-grid-tilemap-system-unity) inspired me to use my programming abilities to make my own implementation, as I couldn't find more anywhere. 

Everything is open source and it's also available in the Unity Asset Store __for free__ so anyone can readily use it without having to get it from Git.

Thanks for reading.
