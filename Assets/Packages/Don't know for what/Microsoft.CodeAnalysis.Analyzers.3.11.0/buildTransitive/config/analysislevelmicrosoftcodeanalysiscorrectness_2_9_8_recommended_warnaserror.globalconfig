# 'MicrosoftCodeAnalysisCorrectness' Rules from '2.9.8' release with 'Recommended' analysis mode escalated to 'error' severity
# Description: 'MicrosoftCodeAnalysisCorrectness' Rules with enabled-by-default state from '2.9.8' release with 'Recommended' analysis mode. Rules that are first released in a version later than '2.9.8' are disabled. Enabled rules with 'warning' severity are escalated to 'error' severity to respect 'CodeAnalysisTreatWarningsAsErrors' MSBuild property.
